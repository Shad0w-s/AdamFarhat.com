## Problem

Design systems need to be both flexible and consistent. Many teams struggle with maintaining visual coherence while allowing for creative expression across different product areas.

## Solution

Developed a comprehensive design system that balances structure with adaptability. Created a modular component library with clear guidelines for customization, ensuring brand consistency while enabling designers to express unique solutions.

## Outcome

Reduced design-to-development handoff time by 40%. The system is now used across 12 product teams, with 95% component reuse rate. Design consistency scores improved from 68% to 94%.

## Reflection

The key was finding the right level of abstraction—too rigid and it stifles creativity, too loose and it defeats the purpose. The sweet spot was creating clear boundaries with flexible implementation options.
